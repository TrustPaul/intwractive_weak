**Bias in Bios**
We use the Bias in Bios dataset from which we create binary classification tasks to distinguish difficult pairs among frequently occurring occupations. Specifically, we create the following subsets with equally sized train and test sets: journalist or photographer (n = 32 258), professor or teacher (n = 24 588), painter or architect (n = 12 236), professor or physician (n = 54 476).
